## Intro
My research focuses on the impacts of global change to Earth surface systems, particularly regarding high mountain environments. Owing to the complex interactions and feedbacks involved, I favor cross-disciplinary approaches combining concepts from glaciology, climatology, ecology, geology and geomorphology. A key component of my work is the development of quantitative tools in remote sensing and geomatics to effectively process and analyze large datasets.
