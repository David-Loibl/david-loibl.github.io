*Under conctruction*

## Topics

* Climate change adaptation of mountain glaciers, particularly morphometry, changes in volume and velocity, mass balances, transient snow line and equillibrium line altitude measurements
* Changes in Earth surface processes since the Little Ice Age and projections in the context of future warming
* Topoclimatic forcing in high mountain environments and their role in controlling sensititve process-response systems

# Methods
* Remote sensing: SAR interferometry, multispectral satellite imagery, UAV-based strucutre-from-motion, LiDAR
* GIS: DEM-based spatial analysis, Google Earth Engine processing
* Computing: Python-based data analysis, parallelized high-performance computing
* Field methods: geomorphological mapping, sedimentology, land form dating, meteorological measurements, drone flights

# Focus regions
* High Mountain Asia: Tibet, Tien Shan, Himalayas
* Central Europe
