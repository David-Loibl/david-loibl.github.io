Computer lab excercise in the Global Change Geography Master programme at HU Berlin.

Learning aims
======
The students can describe, explain and systematise different advanced statistical and mathematical approaches to the quantitative analysis of geo- and environmental data and the modelling of human-environment systems, e.g. methods of applied and multivariate statistics, mathematical modelling and time series analysis. On the basis of the acquired theoretical and exemplified knowledge, the students can apply existing approaches independently and adapt them to specific problems where necessary. They can develop scientific research questions in the fields of data analysis and modelling and, using the acquired applied programming skills, plan and implement their own analyses.
